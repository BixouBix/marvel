= Marvel API Wrapper
[Stage 3: Ruby]
:toc:
:showtitle:

TL;DR: Write a wrapper for Marvel API that supports characters and comics.

== Tasks

You're free to write it the way you like it. The only suggestion is to use the
basic Gem structure (a `lib` directory with an Ruby file, the name of your Gem
where you can setup your code) and the layout of your choice. Try to keep things
*SOLID*.

You already start with a valid set of keys and the params needed to connect to
the API. Feel free to move that code (or replace it entirely) to wherever you
like.

The acceptance requirements are:

* A wrapper for the https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/getCreatorCollection_get_0[characters endpoint].
** You need to able to manipulate an object, so you can do things like
   `character.name` and `character.description`
** You also need to be able to search a character by name, as a match or as a
   lookup. Check the `name` and `nameStartsWith` query parameters
* A wrapper for the https://developer.marvel.com/docs#!/public/getComicsCollection_get_6[comic endpoint].
** Setup the association from characters to comics, so you can
   `character.comics` and get a collection of `Comic` objects
* Write the corresponding tests/specs

You *can*:

- Add any dependencies (except for an already existing wrapper for this API)
- Use any HTTP ruby client
- Use any HTTP standalone client such as Postman or cURL
- Browse through any docs or forums
- Modify or replace entirely the available code

You *cannot*:

- Use an already existing wrapper for this API
- Hard code the API's response

== Pitfalls

. This is *Happy-path only*. Just make it work. No need to cover every single
  corner case.
. Keep it as simple as possible. If you're writing more than a few lines per
  method, take a step back and make sure you're not overthinking it.
